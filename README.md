# TDI_Capstone_Project_2020

Proposal

Based on world bank report. The high employment rate and deficit in skilled labor for various company and indusry is growing fast.

My project proposition will be based on the following projection from Linkdln data found HERE

- Analysis and correlation between empployee growth and number of followers
- How employee can 

 p. This project can be used for two sides of meetup audience: potential organizer and potential member looking to join a meetup group.


Apart from this, letâ€™s say you relocate to a new place and have a general area of interest that you would like to find meetup group for. Finding best meetup for you could be challenging if there are multiple meetup groups surrounding the same topic. You may have to manually sift through multiple groups looking at the average reviews, number of members, frequency of their events.

Data:

I will be utilizing data extract from linkedln between the year 2016 and 2017. The data will be focus on the number of followers, number of empoyee for each company in
information technology and services industry


Basic Analysis:

From Analysis and results, I would be able to predict the possibility of closing skills gap 
We would like to see how the meetup topics differ in different cities such as San Francisco, CA and Santa Fe, NM
We would also like to see how Python meetup groups differ across the globe
